# Dot

An ugly language "interpreter" inspired by Brainfuck... I'm boring. And yes, it's Python... Ugly as I said. Actually I don't know why I'm writing this README right now. Maybe I need some vacation. I was thinking about traveling to the south... I like dolphins. 

Oh, and this shit works btw. üê¨

**Note:** Any reason about the usage of Hexademical notation. Just for fun. üêí
